# Regex

## Description 

- In this project I created a tutorial on regular expression. I did some heavy reseach and wrote down some notes in which I thought was useful
to use for later.
- I learned more about regualr expression like why its useful and how it works. I also know the long history of the topic which to my surprise starts way back in 1951
- This helped me get a better understanding how computer programming and software runs and works.

## Usage

This could be used as a study guide for someone who is majoring in computer science or taking some type of computer programming classes.
