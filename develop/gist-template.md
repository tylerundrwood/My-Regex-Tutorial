# My Regex Tutorial

Regular Expression also known as Regex is a tool used for matching and maniputlation of patterns and strings. Most commonly used in programming 
and data technology like search engines. Although it originated in 1951, different forms have been created since but it has since continued to be 
roughly the same and still used greatly today. 

## Summary

/^(https?:\/\/)?(www\.)?([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)\.([a-z]{2,6})(\/\S*)?$/ Also known as matching URLs, use match patterns to link a specific set of urls to specify where youll end up during a search. URL match patterns are made up of three parts: scheme, host and path.

## Regex Components
Regex has a wide range of key components, all of which are used to make the desired function work. Literals, Metacharacters,Character Classes, Ranges, Negation,Escape Sequences, Anchors, Quantifiers, Flags and Comments are the key components. 

### Anchors 
Anchors allow you to match patterns within the location of a text over the actual content of the text.

### Quantifiers
Allows the number of occurrences a character or group of characters could be matched with in a pattern.

### OR Operator
In this there are 2 patterns in which you want to match. The OR operator is used to alternate the meaning that the regular expression will match in  the input string.

### Character Classes
A character class is used to specify a group of characters that you want to match within a regular expression. This allows you  to indicate any chracter to be a potential match within  a particular position in the text.  

### Flags
Flags which are optional, modify the behavior of the regex.

### Grouping and Capturing
Helps you stay organized by allowing you to use parentheses to group parts of the pattern together. Once they are enclosed in parentheses it creates a capturing group. Capturing lets you capture text that matches certain parts or patterns.

### Bracket Expressions
This allows you to specify a range of inividual characters that may be considered as a match.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
A concept in which regular expressions dictate how quantifiers behave when they meet multiple mates in the input text. They control whether how little or how much the quantifiers should match.

### Boundaries
This allows where matches should or should not occur. They ensure patterns appear at specific locations that are relative to each other character in the text.

### Back-references
A concept in which regular expressions allow you to refer and match the same text that was captured in the pattern. It is also denoted by "\1" ,"\2" etc... in which the number corresponds to the capturing group.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
These are patterns in which can be positive or negative that allow you to assert the presence or absence of a certain pattern whether ahead or behind its current position. There are also zero width assertions in which they dont consume characters, they only check conditions.

My name is Tyler Underwood, im a student/ junior developer in hopes to make it big in the tech industry. I currently live in Orlando FL although i did grow up in South FL. I have been interested in tech and computers for a few years now and as recet as 2022 I decided that I wanted to learn how to code. I have been greatful for this journey yet this is only the beginning and I cant wait to see where it takes me!
If you need to contact me or if you would like to see any of the projects i have worked on, then take a look at my git hub profile thank you.
