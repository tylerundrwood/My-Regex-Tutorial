# My Regex Tutorial

Regular Expression also known as Regex is a tool used for matching and maniputlation of patterns and strings. Most commonly used in programming 
and data technology like search engines. Although it originated in 1951, different forms have been created since but it has since continued to be 
roughly the same and still used greatly today. 

## Summary

/^(https?:\/\/)?(www\.)?([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)\.([a-z]{2,6})(\/\S*)?$/ Also known as matching URLs, use match patterns to link a specific set of urls to specify where youll end up during a search. URL match patterns are made up of three parts: scheme, host and path.
